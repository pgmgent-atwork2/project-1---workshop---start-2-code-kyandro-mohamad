# Flip'n code

Welcome to Flip'n code!

This is a simple memory game that tests your ability to remember the location of different cards. The game is designed to be easy to understand and fun to play.

## How to play

To get started, simply click on the "Start Game" button on the home page. You will be taken to the game board where you will see a grid of cards. Click on any two cards to reveal their faces. If the faces match, the cards will remain face-up and you will earn points. If the faces don't match, the cards will flip back over and you will need to try again.

## Technical details:

1. This game is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
2. The game board is created dynamically using JavaScript, which means that each time you play, the cards will be shuffled and placed in a random order.
3. The game is fully responsive and can be played on desktop or mobile devices.

## Running the Game Locally

To run the game locally, simply download the code and open the index.html file in your browser.
